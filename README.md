## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nadua, I'm primarily a Roblox scripter, builder, modeler, animator and map designer. I also work on some other platforms more minorly, and probably eventually much more.
I've been coding for 9 years **spottily**, so while I do have years of experience *technically*, it is very patchy. 

My current primary project is Cirice, from Cirical Studios. I'm temporarily working on "NaduAttributes," a "plug-n-play" temporary data storage solution for roblox meant to replace Attributes, Tags, CollectionService and Value Objects.

further description can be found in the projects README, found here:
